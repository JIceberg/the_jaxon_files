### Jackson Isenberg
My name is Jackson Isenberg. I am a rising freshman at the Georgia Institute of Technology and will major in computer science. I am the founder and owner of The Jaxon Files and have been running the site since it was a small subdomain back in 2015. As my opening to the world of programming, this website introduced me to web development and served later as a gateway to my knack for artificial intelligence, scriptures, OOP, and operating systems. I currently serve as the head mentor for the Alpharetta High School Robotics Club after graduating as the Vice-President of the club in 2020. My hobbies and interests include programming, educating, writing, drawing, and watching anime.
